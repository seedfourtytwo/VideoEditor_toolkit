cd audio-extractor
python extract_audio.py video.mp4

# Transcribe the audio
cd ../transcriber
python transcribe.py audio.mp3

# Translate subtitles or text
cd ../translator
python translate.py --lang fr  # Translates to French
python translate.py --lang es --model large  # Use larger model for Spanish
```

## Modules

### 1. Audio Transcriber
Located in `/transcriber`

A powerful audio transcription tool that converts audio files to text using OpenAI's Whisper model. Features include:
- Multiple audio format support (MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, FLAC)
- Various output formats (TXT, SRT, VTT, JSON)
- Word-level or sentence-level timestamps
- Batch processing capabilities
- Word count statistics
- See [Transcriber README](transcriber/README.md) for detailed documentation

### 2. Audio Extractor
Located in `/audio-extractor`

A powerful tool for extracting audio from video files, supporting:
- Multiple video formats (MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, FLV, WMV)
- Multiple audio formats (WAV, MP3, AAC)
- Batch processing
- Special character handling in filenames
- Time segment extraction
- Custom audio bitrate

Example usage:
```bash
# Extract audio from all videos in the output directory
cd audio-extractor
python extract_audio.py

# Extract specific video(s)
python extract_audio.py video1.mp4 video2.mkv

# Extract with custom format and bitrate
python extract_audio.py video.mp4 --format mp3 --bitrate 320k
```

### 3. Video Downloader
Located in `/downloader`

[Description and features of the video downloader component]

### 4. Translation System
Located in `/translator`

A powerful translation system using Meta's NLLB-200 model, supporting:
- Multiple file formats:
  - SRT subtitles
  - WebVTT subtitles
  - JSON files (both array and dictionary formats)
  - Plain text files
- 200+ language pairs
- Two model sizes:
  - Standard (1.3B parameters) - Balanced quality and performance
  - Large (3.3B parameters) - Highest quality translation
- Real-time progress tracking
- Batch processing
- GPU acceleration (when available)

Example usage:
```bash
# Basic translation to French
python translate.py --lang fr

# Use large model for highest quality
python translate.py --lang es --model large

# Translate specific file
python translate.py --lang de path/to/file.srt

# Memory-efficient processing
python translate.py --lang fr --memory-efficient
```

Key features:
- Preserves subtitle timing and formatting
- Maintains JSON structure while translating text fields
- Smart text chunking for optimal translation
- Progress bars for all operations
- Automatic GPU detection and optimization
- Memory-efficient processing for large files

### 5. Audio Preservation in Translation
Located in `/translator`

When translating videos, preserving background music and sound effects while replacing only the speech is crucial for maintaining video quality. Our planned approach includes:

**Audio Track Separation:**
- Use AI-powered audio separation (Demucs/Spleeter) to split audio into:
  - Vocals (speech) track
  - Music track
  - Sound effects/ambient track
- Replace only the vocals with translated speech
- Remix all tracks to preserve original audio elements

**Pipeline for Audio-Preserved Translation:**
```bash
Original Video
    ‚Üì
Extract Audio
    ‚Üì
Audio Track Separation
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Extract Speech Track
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keep Other Tracks (music, effects)
    ‚Üì
Transcribe Speech
    ‚Üì
Translate Text
    ‚Üì
Generate TTS Audio
    ‚Üì
Mix Audio Tracks:
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ New TTS Audio (translated speech)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Original Non-Speech Tracks
    ‚Üì
Combine with Video
```

Key considerations:
- Timing synchronization between translated speech and video
- Volume balancing between speech and background
- Quality preservation of music and effects
- Support for multiple audio tracks
